## Project Description:

A Car-rental Web Application designed to streamline the process of renting vehicles for short periods. The application serves as an interface between customers, customer service representatives (CSR), and system administrators.

---

## User Types and Main Use Cases:

### 1. Customer
- **1.1 Browse vehicles for rent:** A catalog of rental vehicles.
- **1.2 Start a reservation:** Choose location, pickup/return date, view matching vehicles.
    - 1.2.1 Add extra equipment during reservation.
- **1.3 View/Modify/Cancel reservation**
- **1.4 Find a branch:** Locate the nearest branch using postal code or airport.
- **1.5 Rating and review:** Provide feedback and ratings for rented vehicles and the rental experience.

### 2. Customer Service Representative
- **2.1 Check-in process:** For customers with or without reservation.
    - 2.1.1 Create a new reservation if no prior reservation.
    - 2.1.2 Confirm reservation, review rental agreement, process payment if reserved.
- **2.2 Check-out process:** Physically inspect the vehicle, review rental agreement, process billing, and confirm return.

### 3. System Administrator
- **3.1 CRUD operations:** On vehicles, user accounts, and reservations.

### 3. Project Approach and Technology Stack Selection:

### Project Approach:

Our project adopts an Agile methodology with an emphasis on iterative development and continuous feedback loops. We believe this approach allows us to remain flexible and responsive to changes in requirements while ensuring regular deliverables. Specifically, we are employing Scrum as our Agile framework, breaking down the project into manageable sprints with defined goals and timelines.

### Technology Stack:

We have carefully selected a technology stack that aligns with the requirements of our Car-rental Web Application, focusing on robustness, scalability, and efficiency. Our chosen technologies include:

#### Frontend:

- **React.js:** We've chosen React.js for its component-based architecture, which facilitates the development of reusable UI elements. React's virtual DOM also enhances performance by minimizing DOM manipulation.

#### Backend:

- **Spring Boot:** Leveraging the Spring Boot framework for our backend ensures rapid application development with its convention-over-configuration approach. It provides out-of-the-box support for building RESTful APIs, which are essential for communication between the frontend and backend.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as our database solution due to its flexibility and scalability. Its document-oriented data model allows us to store complex data structures natively, which is suitable for our varied data needs in the car-rental domain.

#### Other Technologies:

- **Maven:** We're using Maven as our build automation tool for managing dependencies and building the project. Maven simplifies the project configuration process and ensures consistent builds across different environments.
- **Git/GitHub:** Git version control system combined with GitHub as our code repository enables collaborative development, version tracking, and seamless integration with our CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. Development Tools:

- **Postman:** Postman is utilized for testing and debugging our RESTful APIs. It allows us to send requests, inspect responses, and automate API testing, ensuring the reliability and correctness of our backend services.
- **GitHub Projects:** GitHub Projects is utilized for project management, providing Kanban-style boards for organizing tasks, tracking progress, and facilitating collaboration among team members. We use GitHub Projects to manage our backlog, create user stories, and track the status of tasks throughout the development process.
- **GitHub Issues:** GitHub Issues serves as our primary tool for tracking bugs, enhancements, and tasks. We utilize issues to capture requirements, discuss implementation details, and assign tasks to team members. GitHub Issues also integrates seamlessly with our version control workflow, allowing us to reference and close issues directly from commit messages.
- **GitHub Pull Requests:** Pull Requests enable code review and collaboration among team members. We utilize pull requests to propose changes, review code, and provide feedback before merging changes into the main codebase. Pull Requests also serve as a mechanism for enforcing coding standards and ensuring the quality of our codebase.
- **GitHub Wiki:** GitHub Wiki is used for documentation, providing a centralized location for storing project-related information, including design decisions, development guidelines, and user guides. We leverage the wiki to document our architecture, APIs, and deployment procedures, ensuring that team members have access to up-to-date information throughout the project lifecycle.
